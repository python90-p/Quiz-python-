# Quiz-python-
So this code will provide the interface for a simple quiz with timing . The quiz will be having questions stored is a dict.


The code explanation is as follows:

We will use the module of time.

The second line is where we define the time limit for the total number of questions in seconds.

We start with the code and score as zero.

The questions are stored in a dictionary and the questions will be taken from a notepad in the furthur versions.

The dictionary will always store the questions and answers.

The score of the user will be defined by a math operator source for every answer and the score 
is stored in a variable and printed at last.

The time of the user will also be printed at last.

The host of the quiz can change the time in the time limit variable at top.

The time from the host will be reflected and if the time is according the time limit
is not exceded, or else the time is exceded.
